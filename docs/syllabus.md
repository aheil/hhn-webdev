## Description 

This class is a combination of lectures accompanied by a lab. Lectures cover basic and advanced web technologies, programming languages and recent frameworks. Topics include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript, REST, HATEOAS and MVVM as well as various security topics. Assignments include labs that involve implementing various parts of a web application and a final project.

The course is primarily intended for undergraduate software engineering students who want to learn how to build web based applications. Students of the undergraduate applied computer science course are also welcomed. 

Topics might vary based on the current development in the field of web engineering and web development. 

## Lectures 

Each lecture will cover a specific topic. Work through the given readings and screencasts before the lecture and submit by 9 p.m. the night before: 

* Answers to your homework reading questions.
* Own questions about the topic (I will *try* to answer). 

We will discuss the questions during classes. Please ask, interrupt and discuss as well as point out mistakes.

## Quizzes

There will be two quizzes during regular lecture time slot. There will be no final exam. You need to pass each quiz (40%). There will be the possibility for a second change for each quiz during the finals week in case you failed it.

## Assignments 

There are 6 labs and a final project. Labs will look like real world tasks. All lab have to be done in pair-programming. The final project will be submitted by 2-3 pairs (4-6 students) and presented to the class. 

## Grading 

Grading will be based on a total of 100 points.

| Activities | Percentages |
| --- | --- | 
| 2 Quizzes | 20% |
| Lab Exercises | 35 % |
| Final Project and Presentation | 25 % |
| Homework and Class Participation | 20 % | 

Lab exercises will be graded on the correctness based on both the lab assignment and whether they fulfill the specifications imposed by grading / checking scripts or automated test cases. Grading will be done with a grading scripts, test frameworks and checklists. 


Final grading will take place based on the  German grading policy for tertiary education:

||||||||||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| 
| Points | < 40 | 43 | 50 | 57 | 65 |  70.5 |76 | 80 |83 | 87 | 90 | > 94 |
|Grade | 5.0 | 4.7 | 4,0 | 3.7 | 3.3 | 3.0 |2.7 | 2.3 | 2.0 | 1.7 | 1.3 | 1.0 |

## Turn-in Policy

You are required to turn in each lab in ILIAS; if you have not turned in all of the labs, you will receive 0 points  

You have a total of 72 late hours to use throughout the semester. After you have used up your late hours, each additional day late will incur a full letter grade penalty. Saturday and Sunday both count as days. (Late days are tracked automatically, so you don't need to email before using one.)

## Collaboration

You may not collaborate on quizzes. You are welcome to discuss the labs with other students but you should complete all assignments on your own, and you should carefully acknowledge all contributions of ideas by others, whether from classmates or from sources you have received. Final projects will be in groups, where you should collaborate. All group members will scored the same unless one group member complains about collaboration; individual scoring will take place instead then.
